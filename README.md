# LightWaveRFSmartthingsLocalDeviceCreator
Note requires https://github.com/adamclark-dev/smartthings-lightwave-node-server

This is a Groovy SmartApp for SmartThings that interogates the LightwaveRF Connect server (Gen 1 devices) and then creates devices using Adam Clark's device handlers for each LightwaveRF device

Notes doesn't work for Gen 2 device. doesn't work for legacy accounts with a pin. Only works for switches, dimmers and open/close/stop (relay) devices

Copy and paste the code into a new smartapp in the Smartthings api.
